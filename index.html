		<p>Hi my name is Stella Fisher! I am a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I have had a love for travelling since a very young age. My parents always made an effort to explore new places with me. I have been to many amazing places but have three all time favorite: <b> Madison, Miami, and New York City.</b> Browse through my website to learn all about it!</p>
